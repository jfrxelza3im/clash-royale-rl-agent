# AI Agent with Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning

A project showcasing an AI agent that uses computer vision and reinforcement learning to perform actions and learn dynamically. The system focuses on two main phases:

## Phases of the Agent

### Imitation Phase
- Uses supervised learning to provide a strong initial baseline.
- Prevents the model from starting with randomized weights, ensuring more effective reinforcement learning.

### Reinforcement Learning Phase
- Allows the model to perform actions in the environment.
- Continuously learns from its own interactions to improve performance.

## Current Status

Still under development as part of a second-year computer science project at the Higher School of Computer Science.
